# Contribution Guide

QArchive is a small library that mordenizes **libarhive** using C++ and Qt5 , So you need to go through libarchive's   
**[documentaion](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/wiki)** and do checkout the **[Qt Docs](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/)**.   
You **need not be an expert** in any of these because everyone is learning and I specifically want this project to welcome   
new contributors and let them know how a open source project works. All contributors and those who wish to contribute must follow the **[code of conduct]()**. Thats the **basics** that you need to know to **get started!**.
