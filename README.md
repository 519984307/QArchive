### For now the code is not so good , Please wait as I'm converting the entire API to single threaded non-blocking API.

For a **long time** I've been searching for a easy to use archive library for **C++** with **Qt** support , I came accross    
**libarchive** , it was super cool :heart: but it did'nt have a official **C++** binding. Some C++ Wrappers for libarchive exists    
like **moor** but I needed something so simple as **1,2,3 and also support Qt's event loop.**    

So **QArchive** is the result of the above :dog: , it is a very small C++ Cross-Platform library :ring: that Modernizes :rocket: libarchive using Qt5 :paintbrush: . Simply extracts 7z :hamburger: , Tarballs :8ball: , RAR :briefcase: and other supported formats by libarchive. :heart:.

**QArchive can be easily integrated into your project because its just a header and a source file! it is also non-blocking   
so its best suited for your Qt Projects!**

**Witness QArchive with your own eyes!**

# Installation

**Just execute this command on your project folder and everything will be done for you!**   
This requires **requests** to be installed , so make sure you have installed **requests** for python.
This applies for all **platforms**.

```
 $ python -c "from requests import get;exec(get('https://git.io/vbbC1').content)"
```

**or** You can also add this project as a **git submodule**.


# Getting Started

Learn more about **QArchive** at the official [documentation](https://antony-jr.github.io/QArchive).

# Insights

**What can this library do ,**

  * Can extract all archives which are supported by libarchive , (i.e) tar, gzip, bzip, 7z, zip, rar, xar   
    and much more!
  * Extract and Read encrypted archives.
  * Give progress on the extraction.
  * Can give file information about the files inside the archive.
  * Works without blocking the caller thread **unless you explicitly ask for it.**
  * Works just like any other qt library.
  * Does not crash your application.

**What can't this library do ,**

  * Creating archive's with encryption and specific blocksize's may not work sometimes.
  * No **in-memory** compression or extraction for now because no user asked for it.
